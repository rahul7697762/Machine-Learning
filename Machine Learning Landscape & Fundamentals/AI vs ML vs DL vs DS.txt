🔍 1. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Definition: AI is the broadest concept. It's the science of creating systems or machines that can mimic human intelligence.
Goal: Make machines “smart” — able to think, reason, learn, and act.

🧠 Examples:

Chatbots (e.g., Siri, Alexa)

Game AI (e.g., chess engines)

Self-driving cars

📈 2. Machine Learning (ML)
Definition: A subset of AI that focuses on enabling machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
Goal: Improve system performance using experience (data).

📊 Techniques:

Supervised Learning (e.g., linear regression, SVM)

Unsupervised Learning (e.g., k-means, PCA)

Reinforcement Learning (e.g., Q-learning)

📚 Example: Email spam filtering, recommendation systems (Netflix)

🧠 3. Deep Learning (DL)
Definition: A subset of ML, inspired by the structure of the human brain (neural networks). It uses multiple layers to automatically extract features.
Goal: Learn complex patterns from large volumes of data using neural networks.

🕸 Examples:

Image recognition (CNNs)

Speech-to-text

GPT (LLMs)

📊 4. Data Science (DS)
Definition: A broader field that combines statistics, ML, data analysis, and domain expertise to extract knowledge from data.
Goal: Use data to generate actionable insights.

🛠 Tools/Skills:

Python, SQL, R, Excel

Visualization (Matplotlib, Power BI)

Communication (dashboards, reports)

🔍 Example: Analyzing sales trends, customer segmentation
